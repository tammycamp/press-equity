# Press Equity

In today's business world, we are trying to level the playing field by making sure the press is covering a diverse group of business leaders.  We report data on the press and hope to provide the world insights on how the press may have unconsious bias.

**Proof of Concept**

The proof of concept should take the Twitter API and understand who are verified accounts in the business sector.  We would analyze those verified accounts for diversity metrics like gender and people of color.  Then we would take real world data and analyze if it equates to what is reflected in the business world.
To start, this project should segment Twitter verified accounts by category of "business", "verified", and "gender".

What is the result in percentages?

From Twitter we would need to "get all" users of "verified=true"
